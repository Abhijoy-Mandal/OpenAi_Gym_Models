1) Takes in image, (1920, 1080), outputs a vector representing a keypress
Standard game client runs at 240 fps

Model 1:
    look at 10 frames and previous keystroke using attention to generate a keystroke.
    How would we get labelled data?

Model 2:
    Reinforcement learning, to maximize rewards.
    possible rewards:
    1) learn best rewards?
    2) total points (calculated the way RP is calculated)
    3) total points (calculated the way tourney points are calculated)
    4) Damage+kills+position
    (2 tries to emulate ranked, 3 emulates )

First we make a RL algorithm for (my guess of process:)
    1) have a generation solve
